You can also sign up with Google for faster registration. Once verified, you\'ll have immediate access to buy crypto and use all platform features.'},{q:"Do I need KYC verification?",a:"Basic KYC (email verification) is required for all users. Enhanced KYC (ID verification) is needed to become a P2P seller, withdraw large amounts, or access premium features. The verification process is quick and secure, typically completing within 24 hours."},{q:"What cryptocurrencies can I trade?",a:"We support 25+ cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Uniswap (UNI), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), Tron (TRX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dai (DAI).

Browse offers in the Marketplace, select one matching your needs, initiate a trade, make payment via the agreed method (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.), mark payment as complete, and the seller releases crypto from escrow after confirming your payment. The entire process is protected by our smart escrow system."},{q:"What is escrow protection?",a:"When a trade starts, the seller's cryptocurrency is automatically locked in our secure escrow smart contract. The crypto cannot be accessed by anyone until: (1) The buyer marks payment as sent, (2) The seller confirms receiving payment and releases the crypto, OR (3) Admin resolves the trade if there's a dispute. This protects both buyers and sellers from fraud."},{q:"How long does a trade take?",a:"Most trades complete within 15-30 minutes. You have a payment window (typically 15 minutes) to send payment after starting a trade. After marking as paid, sellers usually release crypto within 5-10 minutes. If there are any issues, our 24/7 support team can help resolve disputes quickly."},{q:"What payment methods are supported?",a:"We support 60+ payment methods globally including: Bank Transfers (SEPA, SWIFT, Faster Payments, ACH), Digital Wallets (PayPal, Skrill, Neteller, Wise, Revolut), Mobile Money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, GCash, PayMaya), Instant Payments (Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, PIX, UPI), and many more. Each seller specifies their accepted payment methods."},{q:"Can I cancel a trade?",a:"Yes, you can cancel before making payment. Once you've marked payment as sent, cancellation requires seller approval or admin intervention. If the seller doesn't respond within the trade timer, you can open a dispute and our team will investigate."}]},{category:"Fees & Limits",icon:i.AaD,color:"#F5C542",questions:[{q:"What are the trading fees?",a:"P2P Trading: 0.1% platform fee on completed trades.

We STRONGLY recommend enabling 2FA using Google Authenticator or Authy."},{q:"Are my funds safe?",a:"Yes! 95% of user funds are stored in cold wallets (offline storage) that cannot be hacked.
