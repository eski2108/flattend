# ✅ 3D LOGO SOURCE – FINAL INSTRUCTION (LOCKED)

We are NOT using CSS, CDN icons, widgets, or auto-downloaded assets.

---

## WHERE THE 3D COIN LOGOS COME FROM (ONLY THESE OPTIONS):

### OPTION 1: LICENSED 3D CRYPTO LOGO PACK (PREFERRED)

Buy/download a 3D Crypto Coin Icon Pack from:
- **UI8**
- **Envato Elements**
- **Creative Market**

Search terms:
- "3D crypto coin icons"
- "3D blockchain token icons"

Required format:
- PNG or WebP
- Transparent background
- Already rendered in 3D (lighting, depth, shadow baked in)

---

### OPTION 2: COMMISSIONED 3D RENDERS

Use Blender / Cinema4D

One standard coin template:
- Same camera angle
- Same lighting
- Same shadow

Swap textures per coin

Export individual PNG/WebP per coin

---

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

### EVERY COIN = ITS OWN FILE

Path format (locked):
```
/assets/coins/3d/{symbol}.png
```

Examples:
```
btc.png
eth.png
pepe.png
tfuel.png
```

### NO CSS "FAKE 3D"
### NO ICON FONTS
### NO RANDOM DOWNLOADS
### NO CDN FALLBACKS

If a coin does not have a real 3D PNG/WebP → it stays as placeholder and does not ship.

---

## CURRENT STATUS (FOR REFERENCE):

- **19 coins** already using real 3D logos (from existing pack)
- **200+ coins** are placeholders waiting for the 3D logo pack

---

## FINAL NOTE (IMPORTANT):

Once the 3D logo pack is provided:
1. Each file is added to `/assets/coins/3d/`
2. Styles and components are **LOCKED**
3. No agent is allowed to change sizing, glow, or positioning

**This is a static asset system, not dynamic.**

---

That's it. No interpretation, no alternatives.
