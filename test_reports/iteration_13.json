  "summary": "Completed testing of P2P Dispute Resolution flow. Successfully verified that the core dispute system infrastructure is working: test accounts can be created and login, backend dispute endpoints exist and are functional, frontend AdminDisputeDetail component loads correctly and handles errors properly. The main issue is that the full P2P flow requires users to have crypto balances to create sell offers, which blocks end-to-end testing. However, the dispute resolution system itself appears to be properly implemented.",
