# 🚀 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER

## Purpose
This folder is for NEW features and experiments that don't affect the stable codebase.

## Structure
```
DEVELOPMENT/
├── new_features/     ← New features in progress
├── experiments/      ← Testing new ideas
└── testing/          ← Test files and scripts
```

## Usage

### Starting a new feature:
```bash
mkdir -p /app/DEVELOPMENT/new_features/my_feature
cd /app/DEVELOPMENT/new_features/my_feature
# Build your feature here
```

### Testing before integration:
1. Build in DEVELOPMENT/
2. Test thoroughly
3. Get user approval
4. Only then integrate to main codebase

## Rules
- ✅ Create as many files as you want here
- ✅ Experiment freely
- ✅ Test without fear of breaking stable code
- ❌ Don't modify /app/backend or /app/frontend without approval
- ❌ Don't delete files from stable codebase

*Safe space for development*
