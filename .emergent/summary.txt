<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to fix several critical issues and improve the UI of the CoinHubX platform. The primary requests are:
1.  **Fix Google Sign-in:** This is a persistent, high-priority issue. Users attempting to sign in with Google are redirected to an error page (403 or 404). The user is extremely frustrated with this.
2.  **Redesign the Sign-up Page:** The user finds the current  page absolutely awful and wants it redesigned to match the premium, high-end look of the recently updated  page.
3.  **Re-add Phone Verification:** The phone verification step seems to have been removed or broken during previous edits. It needs to be re-integrated into the registration flow, especially for new Google sign-ups, with a high-end UI.
4.  **Fix UI/Layout Issues:** The user has repeatedly complained about misalignments, incorrect spacing, and duplicated components (like a ticker appearing at the bottom of pages) after visual edits were made. They have requested that the layout be restored to a previously stable state.
5.  **Save Stable Versions:** The user wants the agent to save baselines or snapshots of the application state whenever a feature is working correctly, so it can be reverted to if future edits break it.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The application includes several key pages that have undergone multiple visual and functional iterations:
-   **Login Page:** Heavily redesigned to a premium, high-end standard with an enlarged logo, pulsing animations, and a custom-styled Google sign-in button.
-   **Register Page:** A functional but visually outdated page that the user wants completely redesigned.
-   **Forgot/Reset Password:** A complete, functional flow for users to reset their password via an email link.
-   **Dashboard:** The main user portfolio page, which has been the subject of numerous layout and alignment fixes, especially for mobile responsiveness.
-   **Other Pages:** Wallet, Swap, Savings, etc., exist with a premium design, including a global price ticker at the top.
-   **Baselines:** The agent has created several git tags and file backups to serve as stable restore points (, , ).

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was just about to begin a complete redesign of the **Register page** () to match the premium look of the Login page, while also planning to address the persistent Google Sign-in issue and re-integrate phone verification.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both
    -   **Frontend:** Use the screenshot tool to verify the new Register page design on both desktop and mobile.
    -   **Backend/Manual:** Manually test the entire Google Sign-in and registration flow, including phone verification, from start to finish.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) Google Sign-in is non-functional, leading to a 403/404 error.
-   Issue 2: (P1) Phone verification is missing from the new user registration flow.
-   Issue 3: (P2) User frequently experiences UI misalignment and layout bugs, often due to browser caching.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Google Sign-in is broken**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has made numerous attempts to fix this by:
        1.  Adding detailed logging to the backend OAuth endpoints.
        2.  Changing the backend's configured  path multiple times (e.g., from  to  and back).
        3.  Fixing a double  prefix issue in the frontend API call.
        4.  Repeatedly instructing the user to update their Google Cloud Console.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **This issue is BLOCKED by an external user configuration.** The root cause is that the authorized redirect URI in the user's Google Cloud Console does not match the one required by the application's backend.
        2.  The next agent MUST guide the user to add the **exact, full URI** to their Google Cloud Console's Authorized redirect URIs list.
        3.  The correct URI is: . The agent must first confirm the current preview URL and provide the full, complete string for the user to copy.
        4.  Do NOT modify the backend code further until the user confirms they have saved the correct URI in the Google Console.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical authentication feature. Fixing it is the user's highest priority and will resolve a major source of frustration.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** User action required to update Google Cloud Console.

-   **Issue 2: Phone verification is missing**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent identified that the phone verification step was bypassed in the Google sign-up flow. The agent started adding logic to the backend and frontend to re-introduce it but this was not completed.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Integrate the  component into the  flow for new users, especially those signing up via Google.
        2.  Ensure the backend  endpoint properly triggers OTP sending for these users.
        3.  Verify that the user account is only created after successful phone verification.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with this?** It's a required security step for user registration.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both

-   **Issue 3: UI misalignment and caching issues**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent made many CSS adjustments, reverted files using git, and performed clean rebuilds.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  For any UI changes, work on local component styles only. Avoid global files like .
        2.  After every change, instruct the user to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or use an Incognito window.
        3.  Use the screenshot tool to provide visual proof that the changes have been applied correctly, which helps diagnose caching issues on the user's end.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with this?** Prevents a frustrating loop where the user reports bugs that have already been fixed but are not visible due to caching.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Redesign the Registration Page (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Start from scratch on .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The registration page's UI will be upgraded to the same premium, high-end standard as the login page, providing a consistent user experience and addressing a major user complaint. This task also includes integrating the phone verification UI.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P1) Connect Dashboard & Savings to Real Data**: Currently, many widgets and charts use mock backend data.
    -   **(P2) Fix  page**: This page was reported as rendering a blank screen and has not been addressed.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   Implement additional Earn section pages (Borrow/Lend, Staking, Launchpool).
    -   Complete the Admin Dashboard functionality.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Login Page Overhaul:** Iteratively redesigned the login page to a premium standard, including a larger logo, pulsing animations, refined spacing, and a custom-styled dark-themed Google button.
-   **Password Reset Flow:** Implemented and fixed the entire Forgot Password and Reset Password journey, including frontend pages and backend endpoints.
-   **Layout & Alignment Fixes:** Made numerous, repeated adjustments to the Dashboard, ticker, and other components to fix alignment and spacing issues, particularly for mobile view.
-   **Session Persistence:** Fixed a bug in  that caused users to be logged out on refresh.
-   **Duplicate Ticker Removal:** Removed a page-specific ticker from  that was appearing at the bottom of the page.
-   **Ticker Enhancement:** Updated the global  to have a faster scroll speed and unique emojis for each cryptocurrency.
-   **Baseline Creation:** Created multiple file backups and git tags (, , ) at the user's request to save stable states of the application.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:  broken page**
    -   **Debug checklist:** This page was reported as rendering a blank screen and has not been revisited. The agent needs to navigate to  after logging in, check the browser console for errors, and inspect the component's code.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** It's a core user feature that is currently unusable.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Google Sign-in functionality.
-   **Recurrence count:** 3+
-   **Status:** BLOCKED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, CSS-in-JS (heavy inline styling), ApexCharts.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (via ).
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based for standard login, Google OAuth2 for Google Sign-in.
-   **Styling:** Focus on glassmorphism, neon glows, gradients, and responsive design via media queries and flexbox.

**key DB schema**
-   ****: {, , , , , }
-   ****: Stores user asset balances.

**changes in tech stack**
- No fundamental changes, but a heavy reliance on git for creating baselines and reverting changes.

**All files**
- **Created:**
    - 
    - 
    -  (backup directory)
    - ,  (docs)
- **Updated heavily:**
    - : Multiple visual overhauls and API path fixes.
    - : Multiple layout and alignment fixes.
    - : API path fix.
    - : Updated speed and added icons.
    - : Multiple edits and reverts to fix layout issues.
    - : Fixed session persistence bug.
    - : Numerous changes to authentication endpoints (, , , , , ).

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Styling:** The extreme use of inline styles (CSS-in-JS) within component files is brittle and leads to frequent visual bugs. Migrating styles to a more robust system like CSS Modules or styled-components would improve maintainability.
-   **Redundant Components:** The  page contained its own ticker, which was removed. A review for other duplicated, page-specific components that could be globalized or removed is needed.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-    (Initiates OAuth flow)
-    (Callback from Google)
-   
-   
-    (Update user details)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Google Sign-in is BLOCKED by the user's external configuration.** Do not try to fix it by changing the code. Your primary task is to guide the user to add the correct, complete Redirect URI to their Google Cloud Console. The required URI is constructed from the preview URL and the path .
-   **The user is extremely sensitive to UI changes and gets frustrated easily.** Make small, isolated changes. Avoid editing global files like .
-   **Browser caching is a major source of confusion.** After every UI change, explicitly instruct the user to do a hard refresh or use an incognito window. Use the screenshot tool to prove your changes have been deployed.
-   **Save baselines frequently.** The user values the ability to revert. After completing a significant, approved task, create a git tag (e.g., ).

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Confirmed the password reset is working and demanded that the agent save this state as a new, protected baseline. (Status: **Completed**)
2.  **User:** Stated that phone verification has vanished and needs to be re-added with a high-end logo/UI. Also reiterated that the Google login must be fixed. (Status: **Pending**)
3.  **User:** Complained that the sign-up page looks awful, the buttons are bad, and the Google sign-up flow goes to an error. Demanded that the sign-up page be redesigned to match the premium login page. (Status: **Pending**, this is the next primary task).
4.  **User:** Shared a screenshot of their Google Cloud Console showing an incomplete redirect URI, asking how to fill it out. (Status: **Addressed by agent**)
5.  **User:** Complained that the Forgot Password feature was failing. (Status: **Completed**, the agent fixed the API path).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   Google Sign-in
-   **Mocked:**
    -   Dashboard and Savings page data is likely still mocked from the initial setup, as this was never addressed.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (screenshot tool was used heavily).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** []
-   **Known regressions:**
    -   Google Sign-in has been a persistent regression.
    -   Phone verification was seemingly removed during other fixes.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **User:**  / 
-   **Admin:**  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent never addressed the broken  page mentioned in the initial problem scope.
-   The agent did not connect the dashboard or savings pages to real backend data; they remain on mock data.
-   The agent often got stuck in loops trying to fix issues with code changes when the root cause was external (caching, Google Console config), leading to user frustration.</analysis>
