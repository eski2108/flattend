Withdrawals are implemented and working at backend/API level only (commit 456d2e26251cfb1a0212ae8ea68073bf08df8b1b). API tests confirm correct user lookup, balance updates, fee calculation, and transaction recording. However, withdrawals are not usable in the live app because required frontend work is missing.

What needs to be done:

Wire the frontend wallet page to the correct balance endpoints so real balances display (currently shows £0.00).

Build and connect a withdrawal form in the frontend to POST /api/user/withdraw.

Create an admin transactions/withdrawals page to view and approve pending withdrawals (currently 404).

Ensure frontend uses correct backend routes (several mismatches exist).

(Optional/next) Complete NOWPayments frontend wiring if automated payments are required.


Status: Backend logic complete; frontend integration and admin UI are required to make withdrawals work end-to-end.
