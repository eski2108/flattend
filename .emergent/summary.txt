<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a premium, full-stack cryptocurrency exchange platform, CoinHubX. The user is extremely frustrated with the current state of the application, which is plagued by non-functional dead buttons, inconsistent UI, and incomplete features.

The user has provided a very large and detailed specification document (as raw text) that serves as the single source of truth for the entire platform's design and functionality. This specification dictates everything from global button animations, card styles, and input field interactions to the specific layout and functionality of every page, including the Wallet, Dashboard, P2P Marketplace, and Admin panel.

The core requirements are:
1.  **No Dead Buttons:** Every single button on the platform must be functional, animated, and connected to a real backend API endpoint.
2.  **Full NOWPayments Integration:** Deposit and Withdraw functionality must be fully wired to the NOWPayments API for all cryptocurrencies, with dynamic address generation.
3.  **Platform-Wide UI/UX Overhaul:** The entire application must be restyled to match the premium, Binance-level aesthetic detailed in the user's specification, using a global CSS interaction system.
4.  **Complete All Specified Features:** All pages and features mentioned in the spec (e.g., Savings Vault, full Admin Dashboard, Account Page restructure) must be implemented.
5.  **Continuous Work with Proof:** The user has explicitly demanded that the agent work continuously through all tasks, providing screenshot proof of progress for each major section without stopping to ask for confirmation on every small step.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The application has many partially implemented features. A new global CSS file, , has been created to house the user's detailed UI/UX specification for animations and styles. The agent has made several passes at fixing critical pages, notably rebuilding the main  and  to be dynamic and use the NOWPayments API. The NowPayments API key is configured and has been tested successfully via . A number of other issues have been addressed, such as consolidating duplicate P2P marketplaces and expanding backend coin support to 25 currencies. However, the implementation of the user's grand-scale UI overhaul is still in its early stages.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing a massive, platform-wide overhaul based on the user's detailed specification. The most recent focus was on fixing core functionality. The agent added a Transaction History section to the  and then rebuilt the  page, which was previously showing a blank screen.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (A screenshot test of  was performed).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent must systematically work through the user's entire specification, applying the styles from  and wiring up all functionality for each page. For each page updated, a screenshot must be taken to verify the visual changes and provide proof of work to the user.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, , ,  (for toasts), .
-   **Styling:** A global, cascading CSS system driven by  to implement a highly specific design language with animations, gradients, and glows.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB.
-   **API Integration:** NowPayments is critical for all deposit and withdrawal functionality.

**key DB schema**
-   ****: Holds metadata for the 25+ cryptocurrencies the platform supports.
-   ****: Stores user crypto balances, including available, locked, and total.
-   ****: A log of all user financial activities (deposits, withdrawals, trades).

**changes in tech stack**
-   The  library was added to the frontend to support the deposit flow.

**All files**
-   **Created:**
    -   : This file is the cornerstone of the user's UI/UX overhaul. It contains all the specifications for button, card, and input field animations and styles.
    -   Multiple placeholder pages (, , etc.)
-   **Updated heavily:**
    -   : Rebuilt multiple times to be dynamic and meet the user's exact specifications.
    -   : Rebuilt to properly integrate NowPayments.
    -   : Rebuilt to be dynamic.
    -   : Rebuilt but is currently broken.
    -   : Updated to import new global styles and add new routes.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Component Duplication:**  is redundant and must be deleted to prevent future bugs. The agent should be vigilant for other such duplicates.
-   **Styling Consolidation:** All inline styles and styles in  or other component-specific files should be audited and migrated to the  system where appropriate to ensure a single source of truth for styling.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The User's Spec is Law:** You have been provided with an extremely detailed set of instructions for the entire platform's UI, UX, and functionality. Follow it meticulously. The user is frustrated and will not tolerate deviations or incomplete work.
-   **No Dead Buttons:** Your absolute highest priority is ensuring every interactive element is functional. Wallet and payment buttons must be wired to the NowPayments API.
-   **Use the Global CSS System:** All styling must be consistent. Use the classes and principles defined in .
-   **Work Continuously with Proof:** The user wants you to work through the entire list of tasks without stopping, providing screenshots as you complete each major page/feature.
-   **Fix  First:** Before continuing the platform-wide overhaul, you must fix the broken  page.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Demands the agent do everything from the spec, providing screenshots along the way without stopping for confirmation. (Status: In Progress)
2.  **User:** Corrects the agent, stating that the previous final report was premature and that many tasks from the spec are still missing. (Status: Addressed)
3.  **User:** Provides an extremely detailed specification for fixing the wallet page, including animations, dynamic routing, and proper API connections. (Status: Implemented)
4.  **User:** Accuses the agent of lying, pointing out that the wallet buttons were not working despite the agent's claims. (Status: Addressed; the agent found and fixed the root cause).
5.  **User:** Asks for confirmation on liquidity connection, profit margins, and the removal of an error toast. (Status: Addressed)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -    (renders a blank/black screen).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (via screenshot tool).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** []
-   **Known regressions:** The  page broke after being rebuilt.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Buyer/User:**  / 
-   **Admin:**  /  (Admin Code: )

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has repeatedly underestimated the scope of the user's requests. After being told to apply styles to every button on the entire platform, the agent only updated the Wallet page. It has yet to systematically apply the  styles and functionality fixes to all other pages as detailed in the spec, including:
-   P2P Marketplace (offer cards, buttons)
-   Home Page (feature boxes)
-   Account Page (needs full restructure)
-   Admin Dashboard (needs full implementation)
-   Swap, Savings, and Referrals pages.</analysis>
