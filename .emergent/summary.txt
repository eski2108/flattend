*Fix the user settings page — the Save button doesn’t work, and the user cannot update or save their profile details.
Make sure saving profile changes updates correctly in the database without touching or modifying ANY backend wallet or liquidity logic.
Do not change or refactor the backend routes, wallet services, balance logic, portfolio logic, liquidity logic, or anything connected to my funds.

Fix the Allocations page so there is no overlapping UI anywhere in the list. Everything must sit cleanly inside the container with proper spacing.

Confirm that all frontend work is backed up to the rule-stats workspace, and make sure nothing breaks when deploying.

Only work on: – the Save button + profile update flow
– the overlapping UI on the allocations page
– frontend stability and cleanup

Do NOT modify backend financial logic under any circumstances.
