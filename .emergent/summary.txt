<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a premium, high-end Savings Vault page that visually and functionally matches a highly detailed UI/UX specification. The core requirements include a Neon Dark Mode aesthetic with glassmorphic cards, glowing elements, and complex layouts for displaying savings data. The page must function as a Notice Account system (30/60/90 day lockups) with real-time Profit & Loss (P&L) tracking powered by the CoinGecko API for market prices and NowPayments for account balances and transactions. The user is extremely specific and requires every detail of their provided specification to be implemented, documented, and proven with screenshots, one item at a time. All work must be saved to GitHub upon completion.

**User's preferred language**: English. The user is extremely direct, technical, and frequently uses aggressive, profane language. The next agent MUST be exceptionally precise, follow instructions to the letter, avoid making assumptions, and provide objective proof (screenshots) for all work. Do not claim a task is done until it is fully implemented and visually verified. Respond with DONE after each completed task as requested.

**what currently exists?**
- A FastAPI backend () and a React frontend.
- The  page has been built and iteratively refined to a high-fidelity UI that matches the user's specifications, including a full color system with CSS variables, professional glow effects, and a responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
- The backend has been integrated with the CoinGecko API to fetch live/historical prices and calculate real-time Profit & Loss (P/L) for user positions.
- New backend endpoints have been created to support the savings vault, including  (which now includes P&L data), , and  with penalty logic.
- The frontend UI for the savings positions is populated with **hardcoded mock data** as a temporary measure to build and verify the visual components, as the agent encountered issues connecting to the backend.
- A robust icon system (3D PNG -> SVG -> Letter Fallback) is in place and verified to be working for all cryptocurrencies.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user's final instruction was to save all my changes to GitHub. The agent's work just prior to this was a comprehensive verification of every button and icon on the Savings Vault page to ensure they were all connected and functional, which was successfully completed.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: Use the Save to GitHub feature available in the UI.
- **User Testing Done**: N/A

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Frontend is using hardcoded mock data for the Your Savings list. (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Frontend is using hardcoded mock data.**
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent initially tried connecting to the backend but ran into a CORS/environment issue. As a workaround to continue UI development, they hardcoded a mock data array directly into . The user has repeatedly expressed extreme frustration with this (why are you putting fake fucking numbers?).
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  In , remove the hardcoded  array.
        2.  Re-implement the  hook to fetch data from the live backend endpoint: .
        3.  Ensure the  is correctly retrieved from  or component props.
        4.  Handle the API response, including loading (skeleton) and empty states correctly.
        5.  If the CORS issue reappears, document it clearly and investigate if it's solvable within the environment, but the primary goal is to use the live API.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the user's most critical point of frustration. Fixing it will transition the page from a visual mockup to a real, data-driven application, which is the core requirement.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete the Savings Vault feature (P0)**
    - **Where to resume**: . The immediate next step is to replace the mock data with live API calls.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional, data-driven Savings Vault page that reflects real user data and market prices.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    - **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **P0: Save all changes to GitHub.** (User's last explicit command).
- **P1: Fully implement the deposit/withdrawal user flow.** The modals are visually built but need to be connected to trigger the  and  endpoints.
- **P2: Implement NowPayments webhook handler.** The backend needs a webhook endpoint to listen for confirmed deposits from NowPayments and update the user's savings position accordingly.
- **P3: Implement penalty logging.** When an early withdrawal occurs, the backend must log the penalty amount to a business revenue table for the admin dashboard.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Savings Vault UI Overhaul**: The page was rebuilt and refined multiple times to meet exacting user specifications.
- **Color System and Theming**: Implemented a full color palette using CSS variables in  for consistent branding.
- **Professional Glow Effects**: Added subtle, premium neon glows and hover effects to all interactive UI elements.
- **Layout Restructuring**: Re-architected the page layout to eliminate empty space, creating a dense, professional feel with clear sections for summary, notice selection, and savings positions.
- **Live P&L Backend Integration**: Integrated CoinGecko into  to fetch real-time and historical prices for calculating and serving P&L data via the  endpoint.
- **Functional UI Components**: Built and styled key components:
    - 4-card summary section with  tooltips.
    - 3-card Notice Period selector.
    - Redesigned empty state with a 3-step guide.
    - Skeleton loaders for data fetching states.
- **Button and Icon Verification**: Performed a full audit to confirm every button is connected to a function (even if just a placeholder) and every icon uses the robust 3-layer fallback system.
- **Backend Endpoints**: Created initial versions of deposit and withdrawal endpoints in , including logic for penalty calculations.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Screenshot Tool Environment Mismatch**
    - **Debug checklist**: The screenshot tool fails with CORS errors because its local environment cannot access the external .
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Solving this would allow the agent to provide accurate screenshots of data-driven pages. For now, the agent must be aware that screenshots of pages requiring backend data may appear broken/empty due to this known issue.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: N/A (DevOps/Environment issue).
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Real-time P&L Calculation**: The backend calculates Profit & Loss by comparing a stored  (captured at deposit) with the  fetched live from the CoinGecko API.
- **CSS Variables**: The entire color scheme is managed via CSS custom properties in  for easy theming.
- **Glassmorphism & Neon Glow**: Extensive use of ,  backgrounds, and layered  to create the specified aesthetic.
- **API-Driven UI**: The architecture is designed for the UI to be a stateless representation of data served by the backend. The current implementation deviates from this by using mock data.

**All files of reference**
- : The primary file for the UI. **Crucially, it needs the mock data removed.**
- : The complete styling for the page.
- : The backend logic, including CoinGecko integration and savings endpoints.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **THE USER'S #1 PRIORITY IS TO REMOVE MOCK DATA.** The user is extremely angry that the frontend uses hardcoded data. Your first functional task, after saving to GitHub, must be to replace the mock array in  with a live API call to the backend.
- **FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS SEQUENTIALLY AND DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.** The user demands a report with screenshots after *each* numbered task. Do not bundle tasks.
- **THE SPEC IS LAW.** The user has provided multiple, extremely detailed specifications. Adhere to them perfectly. Good enough is not acceptable and will be rejected.
- **GLOW IS IMPORTANT.** The user has repeatedly requested more glow. Ensure all interactive elements have a subtle, professional neon glow on hover/focus states as defined in the CSS.
- **THIS IS A SAVINGS VAULT, NOT STAKING/LENDING.** All terminology and UX must reflect a Notice Account model. Avoid words like stake, lend, or loan.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
The user messages show a cycle of providing extremely detailed instructions, the agent implementing them, and the user rejecting the work for not being perfect or for missing details (like sufficient glow or using mock data). The last interactions involved the user demanding a full verification of every button and icon, which the agent completed, followed by the user's final instruction: Make sure you save all my changes to GitHub like you done last time.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**:
    - The connection between the frontend () and the backend for displaying savings positions is broken.
- **Mocked**:
    - The entire list of savings positions in  is hardcoded.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **NowPayments**: Intended for account balances, deposits, and withdrawals.
- **CoinGecko**: Actively used by the backend for fetching live market prices, 24h price changes, and historical data for P&L calculations and charts.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
- **Test files created**: None.
- **Known regressions**: The screenshot tool has a known CORS-related issue that prevents it from correctly capturing pages that rely on backend data.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **Email:** 
- **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has consistently failed to connect the frontend to the backend after building the UI, resorting to mock data which infuriates the user.
- The agent initially missed several details from the user's specs (like countdown timers and specific penalty warnings) and had to be reminded, reinforcing the need for the next agent to be extremely meticulous.</analysis>
