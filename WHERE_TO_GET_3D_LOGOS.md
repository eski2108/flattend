# WHERE YOU GET THE 3D COIN LOGOS (DOWNLOADABLE – NO GUESSWORK)

**YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD RANDOM ICONS OR USE CDNS.**

---

## YOU MUST SOURCE PROPER 3D-RENDERED CRYPTO LOGO PACKS FROM THESE PLACES ONLY:

### 1. ENVATO ELEMENTS
Search exactly: **"3D Crypto Coin Icons"**
Download the full pack (PNG or WebP, transparent).
These packs usually contain 100–300 coins with consistent lighting.

### 2. UI8
Search: **"3D Crypto Icons"**
These are premium, professionally rendered packs.
Download once, reuse locally.

### 3. CREATIVE MARKET
Search: **"3D Cryptocurrency Icons"**
Same rule: PNG/WebP, transparent background, consistent angle.

## ONCE DOWNLOADED:

### EACH COIN MUST HAVE ITS OWN FILE

Naming format: `/assets/coins/3d/{symbol}.png`

Example: `btc.png`, `eth.png`, `pepe.png`

---

## RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

- **NO CSS FAKE 3D**
- **NO ICON FONTS**
- **NO CDNs**
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS IN FINAL UI**
- **IF A COIN HAS NO 3D LOGO → IT DOES NOT DISPLAY**

---

## THIS IS A LOCAL ASSET SYSTEM ONLY.

**DOWNLOAD THE PACK → DROP FILES INTO THE FOLDER → DONE.**

**THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THEM.**
