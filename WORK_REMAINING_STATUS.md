---

---

### 2. Referral System - Incomplete

**Current State:**
- ✅ Standard tier (20%) implemented
- ❌ VIP tier (£150 package, 20%) - Backend added, NOT TESTED
- ✅ Golden tier (50%) implemented

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Frontend UI for VIP purchase
- ❌ Admin UI to manually assign Golden tier
- ❌ Full testing of all 3 tiers
- ❌ Verification that commissions work for all tiers
- ❌ Screenshot proof

**Status:** Partially implemented, needs frontend and testing

---

### 3. Comprehensive Testing - NOT DONE

**Required:**
- ❌ End-to-end test for ALL 18 fee types
- ❌ Screenshot proof for each fee showing:
  - User action
  - Fee % applied
  - Admin/referrer split
  - Database log entry
  - Business Dashboard display
- ❌ Test all 3 referral tiers with proof
- ❌ Verify fee editing works and updates instantly
- ❌ Confirm Business Dashboard shows real-time data only

**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

### 4. Documentation - Needs Updates

**Current State:**
- ✅ 6 documentation files created
- ❌ Docs claim "production ready" (incorrect)
- ❌ Docs don't reflect 3-tier referral system
- ❌ Docs don't include VIP purchase process
- ❌ Test credentials may be incomplete

**Status:** Needs major updates after testing complete
