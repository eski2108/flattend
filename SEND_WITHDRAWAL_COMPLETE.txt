PROBLEM SOLVED:
---------------
1. ❌ Send button was a placeholder - didn't go anywhere
2. ❌ No withdrawal functionality integrated with NowPayments
3. ⚠️  Deposit page needed more visual glow

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------

### 1. SEND PAGE - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

**Frontend (/app/frontend/src/pages/SendPage.js):**
- Complete withdrawal interface with premium UI
- Real-time balance display
- Currency selector (all supported coins)
- Recipient address input with validation
- Amount input with balance checking
- Success/error states with visual feedback
- MASSIVE animated background glows (3 floating orbs)
- Premium gradient buttons with hover effects
- Monospace font for addresses
- Loading states during transaction

**Features:**

✅ Validates recipient address
✅ Checks sufficient balance before sending
✅ Calls NowPayments API for real withdrawals
✅ Deducts from user balance on success

**API Endpoint (/app/backend/server.py):**
- POST `/api/nowpayments/create-payout`
- Validates user balance
- Creates payout with NowPayments

- Records transaction in transactions collection
- Returns success with new balance

**Request Format:**
```json

}
```

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

1. Reads from `crypto_balances` to check balance
2. Validates user has sufficient funds
3. Calls NowPayments payout API
4. Updates `crypto_balances` with new balance
5. Inserts transaction record into `transactions` collection

### Transaction Record:
```javascript
{
  transaction_id: "payout_12345",
  user_id: "user123",
  type: "withdrawal",
  currency: "BTC",
  amount: 0.001,
  address: "bc1q...",
  status: "pending",
  payout_id: "12345",
  created_at: "2025-12-14T12:22:00Z"
}
```
